    <p><p>As you might notice, the installation of gefr is too complex, requiring several manual actions. User have to remember the long maven coodinator to resolve dependencies. wtf!</p>
<p>So I have been working whole day to simplify the process.Â  </p>
<p>Currently, gefr's approach is to upload pom.xml to a public maven repositoy (sonatype oss). And the source is uploaded to pypi. Pip will find the source and install it. Jip will find the plain pom and resolve it. Because once pip finished the installation, the source package will be erased and jip can never find the pom. So I have to distribute them seperately.</p>
<p>It would be better to invoke jip right before pip exits. I did some investigation about post-install script. And lucky enough, distutils allows you to override default install command. We can use it to invoke jip, in the scope of setup scrript. It does make sense. </p>
<p>Another problem is the original design of .jip configuration file. From jip 0.2, .jip is available as environmen-scoped: we define some custom repositories and the whole environment shares them. But if we have multiple projects in the same environment, jip may waste time to find public artifact in a private repository. Even worse, jip may load invalid artifact from private repos. In the new design, private repositories are defined in pom.xml, as project-scoped, just like most java build tools. </p>
<p>With new jip, to distribute a jython package, you should write a pom in the same way of Java, specifying the dependencies and custom repositories if you have. Then modify your MANIFEST.in to include it to your source package. At last, in the setup.py, define a new install command to call jip and pass the command into the setup() . From the new approach, only 'pip install' is required for end user. Super easy!</p>
<p>Upon the new usage of jip(as a library), I am also considering to migrate from GPL to LGPL or MIT. I have little knowledge about conflicts between licenses. So if you have some ideas or concerns, feel free to let me know.</p></p>
